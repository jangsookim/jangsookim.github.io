#+TITLE: $\mathrm{\LaTeX}$ in VS Code

#+OPTIONS:  num:nil


* Introduction
  - Nowadays most mathematicians use $\mathrm{\LaTeX}$. Since it is quite a
    straightforward software to use, one may not think much about how to write
    $\mathrm{\LaTeX}$ more efficiently. In this course I will walk you through
    how to use $\mathrm{\LaTeX}$ in VS Code. This course is targeted for those
    who already know how to write $\mathrm{\LaTeX}$ but want to improve their
    efficiency. I'll teach you only the basics. I hope that after this
    course you can explore and enjoy more interesting and advanced techniques in
    your own.
