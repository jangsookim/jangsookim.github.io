* Git and GitHub for VCS and collaboration
** Overview
   - Git is a version control system.
   - GitHub is a platform to share codes for collaboration.
   - We will learn how to use Git and GitHub for writing $\mathrm{\LaTeX}$
     collaboratively.
   - We will do so without using "branches" and "pull requests", although these
     are in fact very important concepts in Git and GitHub.
   - In this way you can learn the work flow much more easily.
   - After this lecture, when you feel necessary, you can learn more about Git
     and GitHub in your own.
** Goals
   - Version Control: Keep all versions of your tex file.
   - Go back to any version if needed.
   - View the changes in each version.
   - View the differences between your tex file and your collaborators'.
   - You and your collaborators should be able to edit the tex file
     simultaneously.
   - Merge your tex file with your collaborators'.
   - Limitation: We allow only one time-line (because we don't use branches).
* Preparations
** Installing Git
   - Mac
     - Type the following in your terminal will install Git if you don't have it already.
       : git --version
     - See the instruction [[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git][here]] if it doesn't work.
   - Windows
     - Download "64-bit Git for Windows Setup" (or 32-bit depending on your
        machine) [[https://git-scm.com/download/win][here]].
     - Install Git using default settings.
     - Restart your computer.
** Configuring Git user name and email
    - Before using Git you need to identify yourself by entering this.
      : git config --global user.name "NAME"
      : git config --global user.email "EMAIL"
    - This needs to be done only once.
** Installing VS Code Extensions
   - We will use the following two extensions.
   - GitLens
   - Git History
   - These extensions have convenient graphic user interface.
** Signing up GitHub
   - Sign up here https://github.com/
* Work flow
** Overview of work flow
*** Setting up Git repositories
     - A /Git repository/ is a folder that is tracked by Git. 
     - Git will keep track of all files in a Git repository and its sub-folders.
     - You first need to set up your local and remote repositories.
     - The local repository is an actual folder in your computer.
     - The remote repository is located in the GitHub server.
*** Commit, Push, and Pull
    - Once you set up local and remote repositories, they are identical now.
    - After making some changes in your files, you need to "commit", which will
      tell Git that the files have been changed.
    - Now only your local repository has been update.
    - To update the remote repository, you need to "push".
    - If your collaborators have changed the remote repository, then you first
      need to "pull" in order to make your local repository up-to-date.

** Setting up Git repositories
   - There are two ways to create Git repositories.
   - The first one is using your own folder.
   - The second one is using already existing GitHub repository.
   - Every Git repository has a hidden folder named ~.git~.
   - NEVER touch this hidden folder!
*** From a folder in your computer
     1. Open your folder in VS Code that you want to make a Git repository.
     2. Click the icon "Source Control" on the left.
     3. Click "Publish to GitHub".
     4. Command Palette (CP) will be opened with two options:
        - Publish to GitHub private repository
        - Publish to GitHub public repository
     5. Select "Publish to GitHub private repository" and select only the tex
        file (NOT the pdf file!) and other necessary files to compile the tex
        file.
*** From already existing GitHub repository
    - Visit the GitHub repository that you want to make a remote repository.
    - In the Code tap click the green button "Code".
    - Copy the https address.
    - Go to the "Explorer" tap in your VS Code and close everything using "Close
      Folder" in "File" tap.
    - Click "Clone Repository" and enter the https address here.
    - Select the location of your local repository.

*** Inviting your collaborators or accepting the invitation
    - If your collaborators created the remote repository, they will invite you
      to the repository.
    - If you created the remote repository, you need to invite them as follows.
    - Login to GitHub and visit the GitHub repository you want to share.
    - Click "Settings" and click "Manage access".
    - Click "Invite a collaborator" and add your collaborator one at a time.
    - Once they accept the invitation they will be able to change the files.

** Commits
   - [[https://git-scm.com/docs/user-manual][Git manual]] defines a /commit/ as a single point in the Git history.
   - We will simply think of a commit as a version of your tex file.
   - A commit has two parts.
     - Move changed files to the staged area.
     - Make a commit with a commit message.
*** Making commits using VS Code
     - Click the "Source Control" icon on the left.
     - Each file has a mark.
       - U means the file is untracked by Git.
       - M means the file is modified (and is kept tract of by Git).
     - Click the + button on the modified file (marked M).
     - The file will be move to "Staged Changes".
     - Write a commit message in the message box and enter CMD+ENTER.

** Push and Pull
   - Push is the command that updates the remote repository with the local repository.
   - Pull is the other way around.
   - To push type "Git: Push" in CP.
   - To pull type "Git: Pull" in CP.
** Merge
   - If your local repository is not up-to-date, you have to pull first and then push.
   - If there are no conflicts Git will automatically merge the two files from
     local and remote repositories.
   - If there are conflicts, you have to merge the two files manually as follows.
     1. Git will write the conflicts in the tex file.
     2. You can simply click the change that you want to keep.
     3. Once you've resolved all conflicts, save the file and the click the + button.
     4. Commit and now you can push.

* GitLens and Git History
** GitLens
   - GitLens shows who and when the line with cursor was committed.
   - Moving your mouse pointer over this line shows more details.
   - From there you can see the changes when the commit was made.
** Git History
   - Git History shows the history of all commits using a diagram.
   - Enter "Git: View History" in CP.
   - You can investigate each commit by clicking it on the diagram.
   - You can see the file or changes at that commit.
   - In the diagram on the right, 
     - "master" is the current state of your local repository and
     - "origin/master" is the current state of your remote repository.
** Previous PDF files using Git History
   - Enter "Git: View History" in CP.
   - Click the commit that you want to see a pdf.
   - Click "View" icon at the bottom.
   - This will open the tex file when the commit was made.
   - You can build LaTeX and view PDF as usual.



* If collaborators don't use GitHub 
  - You can still do the same thing even if your collaborators do not use GitHub.
  - When you make changes you push as usual.
  - But you have to wait when your collaborators are working on the tex file.
  - Whenever your collaborator sends you their file you need to do as follows.
    1. Replace your tex file with your collaborator's (their filenames must be
       identical).
    2. Commit and push.
    3. Review the changes your collaborator have made.
* Exercises
** Making Git repositories
   1. Download [[file:git-exercises.zip][this file]] and extract it in your computer.
   2. Compile the tex file.
   3. Make this folder a local repository and create a remote repository (Hint:
      "Publish to GitHub")
   4. Select only the tex file when you do this.
** A file from your collaborator
   1. Your collaborator just sent you their tex file. This is in the folder
      "from your collaborator".
   2. Replace your tex file with the file from your collaborator. 
   3. Commit and push.
   4. Review the changes.
   5. Modify the file if you feel necessary.
   6. Commit and push.
** Commits and push
   1. Write contents in Section 5.
   2. Commit your changes with commit message "Add contents in Section 4" (the
      tex file only).
   3. Push.
   4. Check Git History and see the changes that you just made.

* Branches 
** What is a branch?
   - [[https://git-scm.com/docs/user-manual][Git manual]] defines /branch/ as follows.
   - A "branch" is an active line of development. The most recent commit on a
     branch is referred to as the tip of that branch. The tip of the branch is
     referenced by a branch head, which moves forward as additional development
     is done on the branch. A single Git repository can track an arbitrary
     number of branches, but your working tree is associated with just one of
     them (the "current" or "checked out" branch), and HEAD points to that
     branch.
** Creating branches
   - You can easily create a branch using Git History.
   - In Git History, click "+Branch" at the commit you want to make a branch from.
   - Enter a branch name.
   - Then an icon with that branch name will appear.
   - Clicking on this icon you can switch to that branch.
** Merging branches
   - To merge the current branch from another branch enter "Git: Merge Branch"
     in CP and then enter the branch you want to merge from.
   - This will automatically merge the two branches.
   - However, if there are some conflicts between the two branches you need to
     resolve the conflicts first.



* Other tips
** .gitignore file
   - ~.gitignore~ file tells Git what files to ignore.
   - If you add a file to ~.gitignore~ then Git will no longer track this file.
   - To add a file to ~.gitignore~, right click on that file and click "Add to
     .gitignore".
