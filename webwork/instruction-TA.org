    5. Enter the email addresses in the 8th column.
    6. For example, if you have an excel file like [[file:sample_classlist.xlsx][this one]], you should make an
       excel file like [[file:sample_classlist_changed.xlsx][this one]].
    7. Save the new excel file as a cvs file (.cvs). You should get a file like [[file:sample_classlist_changed.csv][this]].
    8. Find the file in your folder and change the extension from =.cvs= to =.lst=. The final file must be something like [[file:sample_classlist_changed.lst][this]].
