* Introduction
- In this tutorial we learn how to edit tex files and how to use org-mode.
- Recall that there are two modes: ~normal mode~ and ~insert mode~
- There is anothor mode, called ~visual mode~, which is a mode to
  select a region, just like what you usually do with your mouse.
- We first need to understand keybindings, which depend on the mode.

* Key bindings
** Notation
- ~C~ means Ctrl, i.e., the control key 
- ~M~ means Meta, i.e., the command key for Mac and the alt key for Windows
- ~C-g~ means hold ~C~ and then press ~g~
- ~C-x k~ means ~C-g~ and then ~k~ (without holding ~C~)
- ~C-x C-=~ means ~C-g~ and then ~C-=~
** Keybindings of basic commands
| mode   | keybinding    | description                                             |
|--------+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------|
| both   | ~C-g~         | cancel entering keyboard input                          |
| normal | ~<BACKSPACE>~ | go to newbiemacs screen                                 |
| normal | ~i~           | change to insert mode                                   |
| insert | ~<ESC>~       | change to normal mode                                   |
| normal | ~v~           | start visual mode                                       |
| visual | ~y~           | yank (copy) the selected region and back to normal mode |
| visual | ~x~           | cut the selected region and back to normal mode         |
| normal | ~p~           | paste after cursor                                      |
| normal | ~P~           | paste before cursor                                     |
* How to edit a tex file
- You can edit a tex file in ~insert mode~ in the usual way.
- To copy or paste you need to change to ~normal mode~ and use the key bindings above.
- To compile the tex file, in ~normal mode~ type ~, b~ (the comma key
  ~,~ follows by the key ~b~).
- The same keybinding ~, b~ can also be used to save the file or to view the pdf.

* Org-mode
- Org-mode is a very useful tool to organize text files with extension "org".
- An org file is basically a text file with mark-down-like structure.
- Your org files will be stored in the folder ~org~ under the Newbiemacs folder.
- In Newbiemacs we use "org-roam", which is a package to connect org files nicely.

** How to create an org file
- Type ~r~ in the Newbiemacs screen.
- Type a title of a new org file. It will open a new org file.
- Write anything you want there.
- Type ~C-c C-c~ when you are done.

** How to search an org file
- Type ~r~ in the Newbiemacs screen.
- Type anything you remember about the title of the org file.

** How to insert an org file link into the current org file
- Type ~i~ in the Newbiemacs screen.
- Enter the tile of the org file to which you want to insert a link.

** How to view the connections the org files
- Type ~u~ in the Newbiemacs screen.
