#+title: Newbiemacs Tutorial: Level 2
#+SETUPFILE: https://fniessen.github.io/org-html-themes/org/theme-readtheorg.setup

* Introduction
- In this tutorial we learn how to edit tex files and how to use [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]].
- Recall that there are two modes: *normal mode* and *insert mode*
- There is anothor mode, called *visual mode*, which is a mode to
  select a region, just like what you usually do with your mouse.
- We first need to understand keybindings, which depend on the mode.

* Key bindings
** Notation
- ~C~ means Ctrl, i.e., the control key 
- ~M~ means Meta, i.e., the command key for Mac and the alt key for Windows
- ~SPC~ means the space key
- ~C-g~ means hold ~C~ and then press ~g~
- ~C-x k~ means ~C-g~ and then ~k~ (without holding ~C~)
- ~C-x C-=~ means ~C-g~ and then ~C-=~
- ~SPC S i~ means ~SPC~ and then ~S~ and then ~i~ (This is
  case-senstive, so ~S~ is different from ~s~)
** Keybindings of basic commands
| mode   | keybinding    | description                                             |
|--------+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------|
| all | ~C-g~         | cancel entering keyboard input                          |
| normal | ~BACKSPACE~   | go to newbiemacs screen                                 |
| normal | ~i~           | change to insert mode                                   |
| insert | ~ESC~         | change to normal mode                                   |
| normal | ~v~           | start visual mode                                       |
| visual | ~y~           | yank (copy) the selected region and back to normal mode |
| visual | ~x~           | cut the selected region and back to normal mode         |
| normal | ~p~           | paste after cursor                                      |
| normal | ~P~           | paste before cursor                                     |
* How to edit a tex file
- You can edit a tex file in *insert mode* in the usual way.
- To copy or paste you need to change to *normal mode* and use the key bindings above.
- To compile a tex file, in *normal mode* type ~, b~ (the comma key
  ~,~ followed by the key ~b~).
- The same keybinding ~, b~ can also be used to save the file or to view the pdf.
- The forward searching (tex file to pdf file) will be done automatically.
- To go to the location of the tex file from the pdf file, do
  "Command+Shift+mouse click" if you are using Skim on Mac and "double
  click" if you are using SumatraPDF on Windows.
  
* Spell checking
- To spell check we need to install a spell checking program (only once).
- Once the program is installed, you can spell check by typing ~SPC S b~ or ~SPC S i~
** Install a spell checker on Mac
- We first need to install [[https://brew.sh/][Homebrew]]. Enter the following in a terminal.
  : /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
- To use homebrew we need to add its path to the system. Enter the following in a terminal.
  : echo 'export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zshrc
- Now install [[https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/ispell.html][ispell]] by typing the following in a terminal.
  : brew install ispell
** Install a spell checker on Windows
- We first need to install [[https://www.msys2.org/][Msys2]]. Click the link and install it as instructed.
- Open Msys2 and install [[https://github.com/hunspell/hunspell][hunspell]] by typing the following line.
  : pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-hunspell
- Open Msys2 and install hunspell-en by typing the following line.
  : pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-hunspell-en

* Org-mode
- [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]] is a very useful tool to organize text files with extension "org".
- An org file is basically a text file with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown][mark-down]]-like structure.
- Your org files will be stored in the folder ~org~ under the Newbiemacs folder.
- In Newbiemacs we use [[https://www.orgroam.com/][org-roam]], which is a package to connect org files nicely.

** How to create an org file
- Type ~r~ in the Newbiemacs screen.
- Type a title of a new org file. It will open a new org file.
- Write anything you want there.
- Type ~C-c C-c~ when you are done.

** How to search an org file
- Type ~r~ in the Newbiemacs screen.
- Type anything you remember about the title of the org file.

** How to insert an org file link into the current org file
- Type ~i~ in the Newbiemacs screen.
- Enter the tile of the org file to which you want to insert a link.

** How to view the connections of the org files
- Type ~u~ in the Newbiemacs screen.
