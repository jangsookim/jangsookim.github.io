* Tutorial 0
** Introduction
- In this tutorial you will learn how to use Newbiemacs.
- You can use the basic features of Newbiemacs in the following Newbiemacs screen.
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 600
[[file:files/newbiemacs-screenshot.png][file:files/newbiemacs-screenshot.png]]
** Newbiemacs Cheat Sheet
- You can view the Newbiemacs cheat sheet by typing ~?~ in the Newbiemacs screen.

** Basic concepts
- By default your Newbiemacs folder will be ~~/newbiemacs~ (~~~ means
  your home folder.)
- The current file name is shown at the bottom of the
  Newbiemacs screen.
- Type ~F~ in the Newbiemacs screen to open the folder containing the
  current file.
- Newbiemacs uses [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil][evil mode]], which allows us to use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)][Vim]] keybindings.
- In Vim, there are two modes called *normal mode* and *insert mode*
- *normal mode* has a fat cursor and the icon at the bottom left corder has orange color.
  #+ATTR_HTML: :width 600
  [[file:files/normal-mode.png][file:files/normal-mode.png]]
- *insert mode* has a thin cursor and the icon at the bottom left corder has green color.
  #+ATTR_HTML: :width 600
  [[file:files/normal-mode.png][file:files/insert-mode.png]]

- Type ~i~ to change mode from *normal mode* to *insert mode*
- Type ~ESC~ to change mode from *insert mode* to *normal mode*
- To go to the Newbiemacs screen, type ~BACKSPACE~ in *normal mode*

** Tutorial overview

- Manage tex files
- Manage miscellaneous files
- Some useful tools
  - Add a figure in a tex file
  - Change variables
  - Convert latex code to HWP math code (for Korean)

*** Tutorial 2
- Edit tex files
- Use [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]]
- Use git

*** Tutorial 3
- More on Newbiemacs and Emacs

* Tutorial 1
** Introduction
- In this tutorial we learn how to manage pdf, tex, and miscellaneous files.
- We will also see some useful tools: *adding a figure,* *changing
  variables*, and *converting latex code to HWP math code* (for Korean
  only).
- The basic concept of managing files is to store these files in their
  directories and search them.
- The directories for these files are under the newbiemacs folder.
- To open the newbiemacs folder, type ~BACKSPACE~ twice and then type ~F~
- The pdf, tex, and miscellaneous files will be stored in the ~pdf~,
  ~tex~, and ~misc~ folders under the newbiemacs folder.
- You may manually move your files into one of these folders.
- However, the recommended way is to create symlinks (explained later in this tutorial).
  
** How to find a pdf, tex, or miscellaneous file
- Finding a file is very easy.
- Type ~p~, ~t~, or ~s~ in the Newbiemacs screen to find a pdf, tex, or miscellaneous file.
- Type anything that you can remember about the file name. 
- It will list all files with the key words that you have entered
  there.
- Choose the file that you want to open and press the enter key.

** Add new files
- Note that it is important to have a good file name scheme so that we can search files easily.
- The following methods will do this effortelessly.
*** How to add a pdf file from arxiv
1. Download the pdf file of a paper from https://arxiv.org/ (You must
   download it into your download folder instead of just viewing it on your
   browser.)
2. Copy the two lines of the title and the authors like this:
   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 600
   [[./files/arxiv.png]]
3. Go to your Emacs with the Newbiemacs main screen.
4. Type ~m~ and follow the instructions at the bottom of the Emacs screen.
5. It will save a pdf with name scheme such as "Author 1, Authur 2, Title".
6. Now you can search the pdf by typing ~p~ in on the Newbiemacs main screen.
*** How to add a pdf file of a published paper
1. Download a pdf file into your download folder.
2. Go to [[https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/index.html][MathSciNet]] or its [[https://beta.mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/beta][beta version]]. (The beta version is more convenient.)
3. Search the paper there. You will see something like this
   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 600
   [[./files/mathscinet.png]]
4. Click the drop-down box at the top left corner and select bibtex.
   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 600
   [[./files/mathscinet2.png]]
5. Copy the bibtex item.
   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 600
   [[./files/mathscinet3.png]]
6. Go to your Emacs with the Newbiemacs main screen.
7. Type ~m~ and follow the instructions at the bottom of the Emacs screen.
8. It will save a pdf with name scheme such as "Author 1, Authur 2, Year, Title".
9. Now you can search the pdf by typing ~p~ in on the Newbiemacs main screen.
*** How to create a new tex file
1. Type ~n~ in the Newbiemacs screen.
2. Enter a file name for the new tex file. (The extension ~.tex~ is
   not needed. This name will also be the title inside the tex file.)
3. Choose a template file. (For the default, just hit the enter key.)
4. Now you can search the tex file by typing ~t~ in on the Newbiemacs main screen.
** Symlinks
- A symlink is a link to a file similar to a "shortcut" to a file.
- Creating a symlink will allow you to search a file without moving it
  to one of the ~pdf~, ~tex~, ~misc~ folders.
*** How to create a symlink to a file
1. Go to the Newbiemacs screen.
2. In your Finder or File Explorer, find a file that you want to create a symlink.
3. Drag-and-drop the file into the Newbiemacs screen.
4. Type ~BACKSPACE~, which will bring you back to the Newbiemacs screen.
5. Type ~S~. Then it will ask you to enter a symlink name. Follow the instructions.
6. On Mac, a symlink will be created in this way and you are done.
7. On Windows, however, it will only copy a string in the
   clipboard. Now open the command prompt run as administrator. Paste
   the string in the command prompt.
** Some useful tools
- Even if you don't use Newbiemacs for editing tex files, you may find the following tools useful.
*** Add a figure in a tex file
- Using Newbiemacs you can add an image into your tex file as follows.
  1. Take a screenshot (or upload a screenshot from your tablet).
  2. Go to your tex file.
  3. Press ~BACKSPACE~ to go to the Newbiemacs main screen.
  4. Press ~f~ and follow the instructions.
- By default Newbiemacs will search the downloads folder and the desktop.
- If your computer saves screenshots in a different folder you can add
  the folder: type ~BACKSPACE~ followed by ~x~ followed by ~3~, and
  add the directory path in a new line.
*** Change variables
- While writing your paper, you realized that you want to change the variable ~i~ to ~j~.
- You cannot simply replace all ~i~ to ~j~, because then it will also
  change a word like ~this~ to ~thjs~ and a macro like ~\int~ to ~\jnt~.
- In Newbiemacs you can do the variable change as follows.
  1. Open your tex file.
  2. If you want the change only on some part, select the region by
     dragging your mouse. (If you want the change in the entire file, you don't have to do this.)
  3. Press ~BACKSPACE~ to go to the Newbiemacs main screen.
  4. Press ~v~ and follow the instructions.
     
*** Convert latex code to HWP math code (for Korean)
- Suppose that you want to use the following latex code in Hangul program (한글 프로그램).
  : \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{a_i}{b_i} = \prod_{i=1}^n c_i^2
- You can convert this latex code to HWP math code as follows.
  1. Select the latex code by dragging your mouse (without ~$~ or ~\( \)~ or ~\[ \]~).
  2. Press ~BACKSPACE~ to go to the Newbiemacs main screen.
  3. Press ~h~ and a converted HWP math code will be stored in the
     clipboard. For example, the above latex code will be converted to
     : sum_{ i=1}^n   {a_i }over{b_i } =  prod_{ i=1}^n  c_i^2
  4. Go to Hangul program and paste the clipboard string in the math
     input window (~ctrl n m~)

* Tutorial 2
** Introduction
- In this tutorial we learn how to edit tex files and how to use [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] and [[https://magit.vc/][magit]].
- Recall that there are two modes: *normal mode* and *insert mode*
- There is anothor mode, called *visual mode*, which is a mode to
  select a region, just like what you usually do with your mouse.
- We first need to understand keybindings, which depend on the mode.

** Key bindings
*** Notation
- ~C~ means Ctrl, i.e., the control key 
- ~M~ means Meta, i.e., the command key for Mac or the alt key for Windows
- ~SPC~ means the space key
- ~C-g~ means hold ~C~ and then press ~g~
- ~C-x k~ means ~C-x~ and then ~k~ (without holding ~C~)
- ~C-x C-=~ means ~C-x~ and then ~C-=~
- ~SPC S i~ means ~SPC~ and then ~S~ and then ~i~ (This is
  case-senstive, so ~S~ is different from ~s~)
*** Keybindings of basic commands
| mode   | keybinding    | description                                             |
|--------+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------|
| all | ~C-g~         | cancel entering keyboard input                          |
| normal | ~BACKSPACE~   | go to newbiemacs screen                                 |
| normal | ~i~           | change to insert mode                                   |
| insert | ~ESC~         | change to normal mode                                   |
| normal | ~v~           | start visual mode                                       |
| visual | ~y~           | yank (copy) the selected region and back to normal mode |
| visual | ~x~           | cut the selected region and back to normal mode         |
| normal | ~p~           | paste after cursor                                      |
| normal | ~P~           | paste before cursor                                     |
** How to edit a tex file
- You can edit a tex file in *insert mode* in the usual way.
- To copy or paste you need to change to *normal mode* and use the key bindings above.
- To compile a tex file, in *normal mode* type ~, b~ (the comma key
  ~,~ followed by the key ~b~).
- The same keybinding ~, b~ can also be used to save the file or to view the pdf.
- The forward searching (tex file to pdf file) will be done automatically.
- To go to the location of the tex file from the pdf file, do
  "Command+Shift+mouse click" if you are using Skim on Mac and "double
  click" if you are using SumatraPDF on Windows.
  
** Spell checking
- To spell check we need to install a spell checking program (only once).
- Once the program is installed, you can spell check by typing ~SPC S b~ or ~SPC S i~
*** Install a spell checker on Mac
- We first need to install [[https://brew.sh/][Homebrew]]. Enter the following in a terminal.
  : /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
- To use homebrew we need to add its path to the system. Enter the following in a terminal.
  : echo 'export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zshrc
- Now install [[https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/ispell.html][ispell]] by typing the following in a terminal.
  : brew install ispell
*** Install a spell checker on Windows
- We first need to install [[https://www.msys2.org/][Msys2]]. Click the link and install it as instructed.
- Open Msys2 and install [[https://github.com/hunspell/hunspell][hunspell]] by typing the following line.
  : pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-hunspell
- Open Msys2 and install hunspell-en by typing the following line.
  : pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-hunspell-en
*** Install a spell checker on GNU/Linux
- Enter the following in a terminal.  
  : sudo apt-get install ispell

** Org-mode
- [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]] is a very useful tool to organize text files with extension "org".
- An org file is basically a text file with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown][mark-down]]-like structure.
- Your org files will be stored in the folder ~org~ under the Newbiemacs folder.
- In Newbiemacs we use [[https://www.orgroam.com/][org-roam]], which is a package to connect org files nicely.

*** How to create an org file
- Type ~r~ in the Newbiemacs screen.
- Type a title of a new org file. It will open a new org file.
- Write anything you want there.
- Type ~C-c C-c~ when you are done.

*** How to search an org file
- Type ~r~ in the Newbiemacs screen.
- Type anything you remember about the title of the org file.

*** How to insert an org file link into the current org file
- Type ~i~ in the Newbiemacs screen.
- Enter the tile of the org file to which you want to insert a link.

*** How to view the connections of the org files
- Type ~u~ in the Newbiemacs screen.

** Magit (git interface)
*** Configuring Git user name and email (one time only)
- Before using Git you need to identify yourself by entering this.
  : git config --global user.name "your_username"
  : git config --global user.email "your_email"
*** Install GitHub CLI (one time only)
- To connect with GitHub we need GitHub CLI (and obvious a GitHub account).
- Install GitHub CLI: https://cli.github.com/
- Run the following in a terminal.
  : gh auth login
- Choose the default options. Then enter the provided code in the web
  browser.
*** Test if everything is working
1. Create a temporary folder.
2. Inside the temporary folder, type ~SPC g i~ to initiate a repository.
3. Type "y" twice and enter any repository name.
4. Create any file and commit and push.
5. Check if this repository is created in github.
*** Newbiemacs git commands
| command   | keybinding                         |
|-----------+------------------------------------|
| ~SPC g s~ | start magit                        |
| ~SPC g c~ | clone repository                   |
| ~SPC g i~ | initiate git repository            |
| ~SPC g p~ | publish to github                  |
| ~SPC g m~ | merge tool for resolving conflicts |

*** Basic magit commands
| command          | keybinding |
|------------------+------------|
| help             | ~?~         |
| show log         | ~l l~      |
| stage one file   | ~s~        |
| stage all        | ~S~        |
| commit           | ~c c~      |
| push to origin   | ~P p~      |
| pull from origin | ~F p~      |
| merge            | ~m m~      |

*** Basic git work flow
1. Edit your files in a git repository.
2. Start magit (type ~SPC g s~)
3. Stage the files you want to commit (place the cursor at each file and type ~s~)
4. Commit (type ~c c~ and enter a commit message and then type ~C-c C-c~)
5. Push (type ~P p~)
6. If your local repository is not upto date, you need to do the following.
   1. Pull (type ~F p~)
   2. Merge (type ~m m~)
   3. If there are no conflicts, you are done.
   4. If there are conflicts, Git will automatically write them in each conflicted file, which you need to [[https://magit.vc/manual/magit.html#Resolving-Conflicts][resolve conflicts]] as follows.
      1. Visit a conflicted file (place the cursor at a conflicted file and type ~RET~)
      2. Once the conflicted file is open, run a merge tool (type ~SPC g m~)
      3. The merge tool will find each line with conflicts. You can resolve the conflicts as instructed in the minibuffer.
      4. Go back to magit and stage the conflicted file that have been resolved. (This file may have been automatically staged by the merge tool.)
      5. Repeat the above process for each conflicted file.
      6. Commit. There should be a default commit message.
      7. Push

* Tutorial 3
** Terminology
- The following are fundamental terms in Emacs .
- *frame*: A frame is what's commonly called "window" that is opened when you start Emacs.
- *window*: Windows are what you see in a frame. Usually there is only
  one window but sometimes you will see many windows in one frame.
- *buffer*: When you open a file in emacs, its content is shown in a
  buffer. You can edit the buffer. If you save a modified buffer,
  Emacs will change the file as modified.
- *minibuffer*: A minibuffer is a small window at the bottem of a
  frame. It is opened when Emacs needs your input for certain
  commends.
** Emacs mode
- Besides *normal mode* and *insert mode*, there is another mode called
  *emacs mode*, which is indicated with blue color at the bottom left
  corner.
  #+ATTR_HTML: :width 600
  [[file:files/emacs-mode.png]]
- To toggle between *emacs mode* and *normal mode* (or *insert mode*),
  type ~C-z~.
- In *emacs mode* you can use the usual Emacs keybindings.
- If you enter other "major modes", such as "help", "dired", or
  "magit", the default mode is *emacs mode*.
- In many of such modes, typing ~?~ shows keybindings in that mode.

** key bindings
- Here are some basic Emacs keybindings.
- Note that ~C-y~ (paste) will be needed if you want to paste something into a minibuffer.
| mode   | command                    | keybinding |
|--------+----------------------------+------------|
| emacs | paste    | ~C-y~      |
| all    | isearch-forward            | ~C-s~      |
| all    | query-replace              | ~M-%~      |
| all    | kill-buffer                | ~C-x k~    |
| all    | increase font-size         | ~C-x C-=~  |
| all    | decrease font-size         | ~C-x C--~  |
| all    | default font-size          | ~C-x C-0~  |
| all    | org-store-link             | ~C-c l~    |
| all    | org-insert-link            | ~C-c C-l~  |

** File managements
- For beginners, I recommend using your system's file manager.
- If you are comfortable with basics of emacs, I recommend [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][dired]].
*** How to open a file in Newbiemacs
1. In your system's file manager, open the diretory of the file that you want to open.
2. In Newbiemacs go to the main screen by pressing the backspace key.
3. Drag the file from your file manager to Newbiemacs.
4. You can also drag a folder to Newbiemacs. It will then show the list of files in it.
*** How to open the current directory in the file manager
1. Suppose that file A is opened in Newbiemacs.
2. To open the directory containing A in the file manager, you can simply type ~SPC f F~.
** Window managements
- If you use Emacs, you will often encounter a situation that the
  Emacs screen is divided into two or more windows.
- Many of popup windows (such as help, warning, agenda, or magit) can
  be closed by simply typing ~q~ (if it's in Emacs mode).
- To maximize the current window, type ~SPC w m~ or ~C-x 1~.
** Buffer managements
- To switch to another buffer type ~SPC b b~
- To kill the current buffer type ~SPC b d~ or ~C-x k~ and select the buffer
** Which-key
- There are many Emacs keybindings starting with ~C-x~ or ~C-c~ or ~C-h~.
- Press one of these keys will show the possible keybingings.
- In this way you can explore Emacs commands in your own.
** Execute command
- In Emacs there are tons of commands you can execute.
- Type ~M-x~ and it will show all possible commands available for you.
