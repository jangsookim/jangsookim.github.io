* Tutorial
** Introduction
- In this tutorial you will learn how to use Newbiemacs.
- You can use the basic features of Newbiemacs in the following Newbiemacs screen. (To go to the Newbiemacs screen, type ~ALT-BACKSPACE~. In MacOS, ~ALT~ is the command key.)
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 600
[[file:files/newbiemacs-screenshot.png][file:files/newbiemacs-screenshot.png]]
- By default your Newbiemacs folder will be ~~/newbiemacs~ (~~~ means
  your home folder.)
- The current file name is shown at the bottom of the
  Newbiemacs screen.
- Type ~F~ in the Newbiemacs screen to open the folder containing the
  current file.
- Newbiemacs provides three editing styles, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)][Vim]], Emacs, and Windows (default). To change the editing style, type ~e~ in the Newbiemacs screen.
- You can view the Newbiemacs cheat sheet by typing ~?~ in the Newbiemacs screen.

** Overview
- In this tutorial we learn how to manage pdf, tex, and miscellaneous files.
- We will also see some useful tools: *adding a figure,* *changing
  variables*, and *converting latex code to HWP math code* (for Korean
  only).
- The basic concept of managing files is to store these files in their
  directories and search them.
- The directories for these files are under the newbiemacs folder.
- To open the newbiemacs folder, type ~ALT-BACKSPACE~ twice and then type ~F~
- The pdf, tex, and miscellaneous files will be stored in the ~pdf~,
  ~tex~, and ~misc~ folders under the newbiemacs folder.
- You may manually move your files into one of these folders.
  
** How to find a pdf, tex, or miscellaneous file
- Finding a file is very easy.
- Type ~p~, ~t~, or ~s~ in the Newbiemacs screen to find a pdf, tex, or miscellaneous file.
- Type anything that you can remember about the file name. 
- It will list all files with the key words that you have entered
  there.
- Choose the file that you want to open and press the enter key.

** Add new files
- Note that it is important to have a good file name scheme so that we can search files easily.
- The following methods will do this effortelessly.
*** How to add a pdf file from arxiv
1. Download the pdf file of a paper from https://arxiv.org/ (You must
   download it into your download folder instead of just viewing it on your
   browser.)
2. Copy the two lines of the title and the authors like this:
   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 600
   [[./files/arxiv.png]]
3. Go to your Emacs with the Newbiemacs main screen.
4. Type ~m~ and follow the instructions at the bottom of the Emacs screen.
5. It will save a pdf with name scheme such as "Author 1, Authur 2, Title".
6. Now you can search the pdf by typing ~p~ in on the Newbiemacs main screen.
*** How to add a pdf file of a published paper
1. Download a pdf file into your download folder.
2. Go to [[https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/index.html][MathSciNet]] or its [[https://beta.mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/beta][beta version]]. (The beta version is more convenient.)
3. Search the paper there. You will see something like this
   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 600
   [[./files/mathscinet.png]]
4. Click the drop-down box at the top left corner and select bibtex.
   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 600
   [[./files/mathscinet2.png]]
5. Copy the bibtex item.
   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 600
   [[./files/mathscinet3.png]]
6. Go to your Emacs with the Newbiemacs main screen.
7. Type ~m~ and follow the instructions at the bottom of the Emacs screen.
8. It will save a pdf with name scheme such as "Author 1, Authur 2, Year, Title".
9. Now you can search the pdf by typing ~p~ in on the Newbiemacs main screen.
*** How to create a new tex file
1. Type ~n~ in the Newbiemacs screen.
2. Enter a file name for the new tex file. (The extension ~.tex~ is
   not needed. This name will also be the title inside the tex file.)
3. Choose a template file. (For the default, just hit the enter key.)
4. Now you can search the tex file by typing ~t~ in on the Newbiemacs main screen.
** Symlinks
- A symlink is a link to a file similar to a "shortcut" to a file.
- Creating a symlink will allow you to search a file without moving it
  to one of the ~pdf~, ~tex~, ~misc~ folders.
*** How to create a symlink to a file
1. Go to the Newbiemacs screen.
2. In your Finder or File Explorer, find a file that you want to create a symlink.
3. Drag-and-drop the file into the Newbiemacs screen.
4. Type ~ALT-BACKSPACE~, which will bring you back to the Newbiemacs screen.
5. Type ~S~. Then it will ask you to enter a symlink name. Follow the instructions.
6. On Mac, a symlink will be created in this way and you are done.
7. On Windows, however, it will only copy a string in the
   clipboard. Now open the command prompt run as administrator. Paste
   the string in the command prompt.
** Some useful tools
- Even if you don't use Newbiemacs for editing tex files, you may find the following tools useful.
*** Add a figure in a tex file
- Using Newbiemacs you can add an image into your tex file as follows.
  1. Take a screenshot (or upload a screenshot from your tablet).
  2. Go to your tex file.
  3. Press ~ALT-BACKSPACE~ to go to the Newbiemacs main screen.
  4. Press ~f~ and follow the instructions.
- By default Newbiemacs will search the downloads folder and the desktop.
- If your computer saves screenshots in a different folder you can add
  the folder: type ~ALT-BACKSPACE~ followed by ~x~ followed by ~3~, and
  add the directory path in a new line.
*** Change variables
- While writing your paper, you realized that you want to change the variable ~i~ to ~j~.
- You cannot simply replace all ~i~ to ~j~, because then it will also
  change a word like ~this~ to ~thjs~ and a macro like ~\int~ to ~\jnt~.
- In Newbiemacs you can do the variable change as follows.
  1. Open your tex file.
  2. If you want the change only on some part, select the region by
     dragging your mouse. (If you want the change in the entire file, you don't have to do this.)
  3. Press ~ALT-BACKSPACE~ to go to the Newbiemacs main screen.
  4. Press ~v~ and follow the instructions.
     
*** Convert latex code to HWP math code (for Korean)
- Suppose that you want to use the following latex code in Hangul program (한글 프로그램).
  : \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{a_i}{b_i} = \prod_{i=1}^n c_i^2
- You can convert this latex code to HWP math code as follows.
  1. Select the latex code by dragging your mouse (without ~$~ or ~\( \)~ or ~\[ \]~).
  2. Press ~ALT-BACKSPACE~ to go to the Newbiemacs main screen.
  3. Press ~h~ and a converted HWP math code will be stored in the
     clipboard. For example, the above latex code will be converted to
     : sum_{ i=1}^n   {a_i }over{b_i } =  prod_{ i=1}^n  c_i^2
  4. Go to Hangul program and paste the clipboard string in the math
     input window (~ctrl n m~)

2. Restart Newbiemacs.
3. If it's still not working, re-install Newbiemacs.
** I cannot compile bibtex.
1. If there is a space in the path of your newbiemacs folder, you cannot compile bibtex.
2. It is strongly recommended that you change your newbiemacs folder so that it has no space.
3. If you need to use icloud, whose path is ~/Users/<username>/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs~, you need to run the following in your terminal. (You have to change ~<username>~ with your actual username.)
   : ln -s "/Users/<username>/Library/Mobile Documents" "/Users/<username>/Library/Mobile-Documents"
