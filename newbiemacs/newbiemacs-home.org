* Tutorial
** Introduction

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 600
file:files/newbiemacs-screenshot.png
- By default your Newbiemacs folder will be ~~/newbiemacs~ (~~~ means
  your home folder.)
- The current file name is shown at the bottom of the
  Newbiemacs screen.
- Type ~F~ in the Newbiemacs screen to open the folder containing the
  current file.
- Newbiemacs provides three editing styles, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)][Vim]], Emacs, and Windows (default). To change the editing style, type ~e~ in the Newbiemacs screen.
- You can view the Newbiemacs cheat sheet by typing ~?~ in the Newbiemacs screen.

** Overview
- In this tutorial we learn how to manage pdf and tex files.
- The basic concept of managing files is to store these files in their
  directories and search them.
- The directories for these files are under the newbiemacs folder.
- To open the newbiemacs folder, type ~ALT-BACKSPACE~ (or ~Command-BACKSPACE~ in macOS) twice and then type ~F~
- The pdf and tex files will be stored in the ~pdf~ and ~tex~ folders under the newbiemacs folder.
- You may manually move your files into one of these folders.
  
** How to find pdf or tex file
- Finding a file is very easy.
- Type ~p~ or ~t~ in the Newbiemacs screen to find a pdf or tex file.
- Type anything that you can remember about the file name. 
- It will list all files with the key words that you have entered
  there.
- Choose the file that you want to open and press the enter key.

** Add new pdf files
- Note that it is important to have a good file name scheme so that we can search files easily.
- The following methods will do this effortelessly.
*** How to add a pdf file from arxiv

*** How to add a pdf file of a published paper
1. Download a pdf file into your download folder.
2. Go to [[https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/index.html][MathSciNet]] or [[https://zbmath.org/][zbMATH]] (zbMATH is free).

   [[./files/mathscinet.png]]
4. Click the ~Cite~ button. This will pop up a window like this.
   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 600
