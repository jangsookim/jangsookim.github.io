  your home folder.)
- The current file name is shown at the bottom of the
  Newbiemacs screen. 
- Type ~F~ in the Newbiemacs screen to open the folder containing the

- Newbiemacs uses [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil][evil mode]], which allows us to use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)][Vim]] keybindings.
- In Vim, there are two modes called *normal mode* and *insert mode*
- *normal mode* has a fat cursor and the icon at the bottom left corder has orange color.
