#+title: Newbiemacs Tutorial: Level 1
#+SETUPFILE: https://fniessen.github.io/org-html-themes/org/theme-readtheorg.setup

* Introduction
- In this tutorial we learn how to manage pdf, tex, and miscellaneous files.
- The basic concept is to store these files in their directories and search them.
- The directories for these files are under the newbiemacs folder.
- To open the newbiemacs folder, type ~<BACKSPACE>~ twice and then type ~F~
- The pdf, tex, and miscellaneous files will be stored in the ~pdf~,
  ~tex~, and ~misc~ folders under the newbiemacs folder.
- You may manually move your files into one of these folders.
- However, the recommended way is to create symlinks (explained later in this tutorial).
  
* How to find a pdf, tex, or miscellaneous file
- Finding a file is very easy.
- Type ~p~, ~t~, or ~s~ in the Newbiemacs screen to find a pdf, tex, or miscellaneous file.
- Type anything that you can remember about the file name. 
- It will list all files with the key words that you have entered
  there.
- Choose the file that you want to open and press the enter key.

* Add new files
- Note that it is important to have a good file name scheme so that we can search files easily.
- The following methods will do this effortelessly.
** How to add a pdf file from arxiv
1. Download the pdf file of a paper from https://arxiv.org/ (You must
   download it into your download folder instead of just viewing it on your
   browser.)
2. Copy the two lines of the title and the authors like this:
   #+ATTR_HTML: 
   [[./files/arxiv.png]]
3. Go to your Emacs with the Newbiemacs main screen.
4. Type ~m~ and follow the instructions at the bottom of the Emacs screen.
5. It will save a pdf with name scheme such as "Author 1, Authur 2, Title".
6. Now you can search the pdf by typing ~p~ in on the Newbiemacs main screen.
** How to add a pdf file of a published paper
1. Download a pdf file into your download folder.
2. Go to [[https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/index.html][MathSciNet]] or its [[https://beta.mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/beta][beta version]]. (The beta version is more convenient.)
3. Search the paper there. You will see something like this
   #+ATTR_HTML: 
   [[./files/mathscinet.png]]
4. Click the drop-down box at the top left corner and select bibtex.
   #+ATTR_HTML: 
   [[./files/mathscinet2.png]]
5. Copy the bibtex item.
   #+ATTR_HTML: 
   [[./files/mathscinet3.png]]
6. Go to your Emacs with the Newbiemacs main screen.
7. Type ~m~ and follow the instructions at the bottom of the Emacs screen.
8. It will save a pdf with name scheme such as "Author 1, Authur 2, Year, Title".
9. Now you can search the pdf by typing ~p~ in on the Newbiemacs main screen.
** How to create a new tex file
1. Type ~n~ in the Newbiemacs screen.
2. Enter a file name for the new tex file. (The extension ~.tex~ is
   not needed. This name will also be the title inside the tex file.)
3. Choose a template file. (For the default, just hit the enter key.)
4. Now you can search the tex file by typing ~t~ in on the Newbiemacs main screen.
* Create symlinks
- A symlink is a link to a file similar to a "shortcut" to a file.
- Creating a symlink will allow you to search a file without moving it
  to one of the ~pdf~, ~tex~, ~misc~ folders.
** How to create a symlink to a file
1. Go to the Newbiemacs screen.
2. In your Finder or File Explorer, find a file that you want to create a symlink.
3. Drag-and-drop the file into the Newbiemacs screen.
4. Type ~<BACKSPACE>~, which will bring you back to the Newbiemacs screen.
5. Type ~S~. Then it will ask you to enter a symlink name. Follow the instructions.
6. On Mac, a symlink will be created in this way and you are done.
7. On Windows, however, it will only copy a string in the
   clipboard. Now open the command prompt run as administrator. Paste
   the string in the command prompt.
